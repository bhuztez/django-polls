on your system

  $ ./bin/develop start
  $ ./bin/manage test
  $ ./bin/manage runserver


./bin/develop start

  prepare the development environment and make sure postgresql started

./bin/develop reset

  when you messed up your database, this will make sure it is dropped
  and then recreate it

./bin/develop stop

  make sure postgresql stopped

./bin/develop clean

   stop and then clean up the develop directory
